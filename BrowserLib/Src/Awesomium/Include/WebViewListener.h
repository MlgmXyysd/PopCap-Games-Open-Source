/*
	Modified by PopCap Games, Inc. for the version included with the
	BrowserLib library.  Change history:

	2009.10.27: Changed onCallback method to use an argument count and
	            pointer, rather than a vector of arguments, in order
	            to resolve DLL interface problems caused by STL differences
	            between VS2005 and VS2008.
	2010.01.14: Added onAllowNavigation for rudimentary white/blacklisting
